# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 16, 2018 (Example 1)

I know somewhat about the web-frameworks and JS, but I want to master myself to a fullstack developer, so today I have decided to create a small blog site as a practice and for this I have choose angular as primary thing.

**Today's Progress**: Have created an repository for blogsite and done basic setup of angular.

**Thoughts:** Though I have just done an basic setup, but I have learned various theoretical things about a blog site & Angular this will help me in further work.

**Link to work:** [Blog Site] (https://github.com/Vino16491/AngularBlogSite).
