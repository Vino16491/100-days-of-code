# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 16, 2018 

I know somewhat about the web-frameworks and JS, but I want to master myself to a fullstack developer, so today I have decided to create a small blog site as a practice and for this I have choose angular as primary thing.

**Today's Progress**: Have created an repository for blogsite and done basic setup of angular.

**Thoughts:** Though I have just done an basic setup, but I have learned various theoretical things about a blog site & Angular this will help me in further work.

### Day 1: July 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
    1. learned how to deploy site online with git and netlify.
    2. Integrated project with Angular material
    3. learned about angular components, databinding and somewhat about decorators and classes

**Thoughts:** Angular is amazing compared to plain javascript, there are lots of things handy for development, and also with angular material, things become much comfortable.

### Day 2: July 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: 
    1. Tried several things from angular material, but failed to implement them properly, will try again tomorrow with the help of tut
    2. used css to create a profile and notification button
    3. Add 2 components in project for profile and blogs

**Thoughts:** Thought angular material will be easy to implement, but it is not that easy, will have to work on angular components and material components basics to have a little grasp on this framework
