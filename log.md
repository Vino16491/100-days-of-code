# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 16, 2018 

I know somewhat about the web-frameworks and JS, but I want to master myself to a fullstack developer, so today I have decided to create a small blog site as a practice and for this I have choose angular as primary thing.

**Today's Progress**: Have created an repository for blogsite and done basic setup of angular.

**Thoughts:** Though I have just done an basic setup, but I have learned various theoretical things about a blog site & Angular this will help me in further work.

### Day 1: July 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: learned how to deploy site online with git and netlify. Also get to know that after each commit the site will be updated automatically as it has been synced with github

**Thoughts:** It is amazing that each edit can directly be pushed to live website.
